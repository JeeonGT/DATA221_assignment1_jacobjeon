question 1:
computes the factorial of all integers starting from 1 until it passes the threshold value which is determined by the function arguement.

question 2:
function that takes a list of strings, reads the length and parity of each string, and assigns a key called length with its value, and a key called parity with its parity. 

question 3:
function that takes in a nested list of pairs of two integers contained in a list, then raises the power of the first integer by the second.

question 4:
generates a list of random values between 0 and 1, and also generates a random value x between 0 and 1. the function reads all the lists that are equal or greater than x, sorts the list then prints it.

question 5:
takes in two radii of circles, calculates the area of each circle, compare the two then divide the smaller circle by the larger circle, and multiplies that ratio by 100 to obtain the percentage that the smaller circle covers inside the larger one.

question 6:
takes in a list, and converts each value into a key in a dictionary, where the value of each key is the percentage of values in the list that are equal or less than the key.

question 7:
checks if the seconds after midnight is at least 0, then converts all possible seconds into hours if possible, if not possible sets hours to 0. Then checks the remaining seconds and if possible, converts them to minutes. Finally prints the remaining seconds. If the original seconds after midnight exceeds 86400, gives a cool error message.

question 8:
creates a data frame from given data, then takes two of the rows and adds them together to add a new row in the dataframe.
